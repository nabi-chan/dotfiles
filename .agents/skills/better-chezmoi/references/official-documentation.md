# Official documentation corpus

Use this reference when a command or flag is version-sensitive, the bundled snapshot needs refreshing, or the user wants official chezmoi documentation searched locally.

## Authority order

1. Installed `chezmoi <command> --help` for executable syntax on the current machine.
2. Live official pages at `https://www.chezmoi.io/` for current behavior and examples.
3. Official GitHub release notes for a newly introduced or changed flag.
4. Bundled snapshot for fast offline search and branch-specific context.

The snapshot is evidence retrieved at a point in time, not a version lock. Preserve retrieval metadata and source URLs in `references/official-docs/manifest.json`.

## Search the bundled snapshot

```sh
python3 scripts/official_docs.py search "dry-run"
python3 scripts/official_docs.py search "persistent state lock" --limit 20
python3 scripts/official_docs.py list
```

Search output names the page and line number. Open only the matching snapshot file, then confirm exact flags against local help.

## Compare with live official pages

```sh
python3 scripts/official_docs.py refresh
```

This fetches the curated official page set into a temporary staging directory, validates every article, compares content hashes with the committed corpus, and reports added, changed, removed, and unchanged pages. It does not replace the snapshot.

Use `--output PATH` to compare against another corpus. Network or HTTP failure is an operational failure, not evidence that the existing snapshot is current.

## Update the canonical snapshot

Run this only in the canonical skill checkout when the corpus update is authorized. It replaces local snapshot files; committing or publishing the repository remains a separate action.

```sh
python3 scripts/official_docs.py refresh --write
python3 scripts/official_docs.py check
```

`--write` stages and validates the complete corpus, moves the prior directory to a recovery backup, publishes the staged directory, and restores the backup if publication fails. It refuses a partial fetch. Review the resulting diff for lost headings, examples, source URL changes, and unexpectedly large churn before release.

Do not silently replace an installed snapshot. For an ad hoc refresh outside the canonical checkout, use `--output` with a writable scratch directory and search it through `--docs`. Propose any instruction changes with the source URL, version, observed mismatch, and a safe reproducer.

## Change the page set

The typed `DOCUMENT_SOURCES` tuple in `scripts/official_docs.py` owns the page inventory. Add a page only when a real invocation branch needs it. Each source needs a stable slug, one official HTTPS URL, and a branch label.

After changing the inventory:

1. run `refresh --write`
2. run `check`
3. run the package validator and tests
4. update disclosure evals if a new branch becomes reachable

## Scraper boundaries

- Uses only Python's standard library and official `chezmoi.io` HTTPS pages.
- Extracts the `<article class="md-content__inner md-typeset">` region and produces Markdown-like text optimized for local search.
- Preserves headings, paragraphs, links, lists, tables as readable rows, and preformatted command blocks.
- Records SHA-256 hashes and sitemap `lastmod` values where available.
- Does not execute code examples, invoke chezmoi, follow arbitrary off-site links, or scrape search results.

## Completion checks

- Every configured page has a non-empty generated file and matching manifest hash.
- The manifest records retrieval time, source URL, branch, output path, and site last-modified value when published.
- Live refresh either passes completely or leaves the prior corpus byte-for-byte intact.
- Exact commands remain checked against the installed binary.
